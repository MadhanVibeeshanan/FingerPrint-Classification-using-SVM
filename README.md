# FingerPrint-Classification-using-SVM

This project the fringerprint image dataset is downloaded from link http://bit.ly/2phOMcN. The dataset consist of 21 fingerprints images having 256 * 256 RGB pixels. The images are converted into gray scale and then cropped to remove the whilte noise. Performed the multi-class classification in non-linear way with RBF kernel in support vector machine using one vs rest classifier. Measured the accuracy of 79.82% using test dataset.
